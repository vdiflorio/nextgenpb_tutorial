# 📦 Dependencies

NextGenPB depends on a combination of custom libraries, solvers, and visualization tools.

## 🔧 Core Libraries (Required to Compile and Run)

These libraries are mandatory to compile and execute NextGenPB:

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lis` | Linear solver for sparse matrices |
| `p4est` | Adaptive mesh refinement using octrees |
| `bim++` | FEM library tailored for electrostatics |
| `NanoShaper` | Molecular surface generation |


## 🔍 Optional (But Recommended) Tools for Visualization

- **ParaView** – View simulation results in `.vtk` format.
- **GNU Octave** – Useful for analyzing `.octbin` files generated by NextGenPB.
