1. Nonlinear ionic density, going beyond the classical low-potential approximation. This linearization neglects important physical effects in systems with high surface charge, multivalent ions, or non-dilute ionic concentrations.

2. Allow more flexible formats for `.pqr` files (particularly with or without the ChainID column) or the use of `.pdb` files
