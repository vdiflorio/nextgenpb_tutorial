In this tutorial, we will use the generic precompiled Apptainer image.  
If you need a custom-built version of the container (e.g., for specific hardware or tuned performance), please refer to the [container installation guide](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/container).

If you are a developer (or simply prefer installing software directly on your machine), there are instructions for both [macOS](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/mac) and [Linux](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/linux).
