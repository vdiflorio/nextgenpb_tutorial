## Disclaimer

In this tutorial, we will use the generic precompiled **Apptainer container**.  
If you need a custom-built version (e.g., optimized for specific hardware or tuned for performance), please refer to the [container installation guide](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/container).

If you are a developer (or simply prefer installing the code directly on your system), installation instructions are available for both [macOS](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/mac) and [Linux](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/linux).

{: .note-title }
> Note for macOS users
>
> Apptainer is not supported on macOS. You can build and use the Docker container instead by [following these instructions](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/installation/container), and adapt the commands in this tutorial to use `docker exec` instead of `apptainer exec`. For more details, see the [running containers guide](/nextgenpb_tutorial/docs/guide/run/container).
