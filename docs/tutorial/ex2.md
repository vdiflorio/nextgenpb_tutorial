# Exercise Two: Use PDB file

In this exercise, we will see how to use `.pdb` files in **NextGenPB**.
{: .fs-5 }

---

## Step 1 – Prepare the Inputs

Go to the directory for the second exercise:

```bash
cd ~/ngpb_tutorial/ex2
```

This will be your working directory:

```bash
~/ngpb_tutorial/ex2
```

Copy a `.pdb` file into your current directory:

```bash
cp ../NextGenPB/data/1CCM.pdb .
```

{: .warning }
`.pdb` files do not contain partial charges or atomic radii, which are necessary to compute the molecular surface and electrostatics. These data are included in `.pqr` files.

So you must also copy the files that provide this information:

```bash
cp ../NextGenPB/data/amber.crg .
cp ../NextGenPB/data/amber.size .
```

### Prepare the Parameter File

Create a file named `options.prm` in the current directory with the following content:

```
[input]
filetype = pdb
filename = 1CCM.pdb
radius_file = radius.siz
charge_file = charge.crg
write_pqr = 1
name_pqr = 1CCM_out.pqr
[../]

[mesh]
mesh_shape = 0
perfil1 = 0.95
perfil2 = 0.2
scale   = 2.0
[../]

[model]
bc_type = 1                                
molecular_dielectric_constant = 2      # Dielectric constant inside the molecule
solvent_dielectric_constant   = 80     # Dielectric constant of the solvent (e.g., water)
ionic_strength                = 0.145  # Ionic strength (mol/L)
T                             = 298.15 # Temperature in Kelvin
calc_energy    = 2
calc_coulombic = 1
[../]
```

---


## Step 2 – Run the Solver

Now launch the simulation using Apptainer:

```bash
apptainer exec --pwd /App --bind .:/App ../NextGenPB.sif mpirun -np 4 ngpb --prmfile options.prm
```

---

## Step 3 – Output and Results

At the end of the execution, you will see a log similar to this:

```ini
...
```

You should also see a new file called `1CCM_out.pqr`. 

This is the `.pqr` file automatically generated by NextGenPB from the `.pdb` input.
