## Quick Introduction

**NextGenPB** is a modern, high-performance tool for solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE), a fundamental equation in computational electrostatics.

This tutorial will guide you through the complete process — from setting up your molecular data to visualizing electrostatic potentials.

Whether you're a student just getting started or a researcher interested in bioelectrostatics, you'll find practical steps and explanations to support your learning.
