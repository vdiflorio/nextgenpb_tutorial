## Quick Introduction

**NextGenPB** is a modern, high-performance tool for solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE), a fundamental equation in computational electrostatics.

This website contains two main sections to support your learning and use of NextGenPB:

- **Tutorial:** Step-by-step practical examples designed to help new users quickly run simulations and understand key features of NextGenPB.  
- **Guide:** Comprehensive documentation covering installation, advanced features, developer notes, and detailed explanations of all settings.

Whether you're a student just getting started or a researcher interested in bioelectrostatics, you'll find practical steps and in-depth information here.
